## How to Add Images:

2. Make sure the filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)

4. If an image is missing, it will show a placeholder

## Image Optimization Tips:

- Use JPG for photos, PNG for logos with transparency
- Compress images before uploading (use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh)
- Keep file sizes under 500KB for faster loading
- Use WebP format for best compression (modern browsers support it)
